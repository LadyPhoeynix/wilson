Oh dear. It appears we have a problem here. If you need help to use the help
command, I think we have a *serious* issue. Luckily, I have a solution.

What you're going to do is this:
:white_small_square: Open your internet browser of choice
:white_small_square: Type into the search engine: `keyboards for sale`
:white_small_square: Fail, because you can't use a keyboard in a valuable way
:white_small_square: Offer your local Jedi Master some death sticks
:white_small_square: You don't want to sell them some death sticks
:white_small_square: You want to go home and rethink your life
